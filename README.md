For this to work you will need the most recent version of python and visual studio code as well as Auto Hot Key. Auto hot key is what controls the macros in your keyboard. There is no extra setup once you have it installed that you need to do. Literally have it on your pc and it will work perfectly as intended. Look them up to download them. For this to work you need to be streaming to twitch. Streaming to youtube wont work. I recommend streaming through streamlabs obs or obs but im pretty sure it works no matter what you stream through. I have only tested it through Streamlabs obs and obs and it works perfectly on both of those. Follow directions to a tee. If you take shortcuts or dont pay attention IT WILL NOT WORK. If you have any problems or questions feel free to message me on twitter @waspr6. I promise I will answer within an hour. Have fun!!!
